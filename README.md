# 🧠 DetectErreur

> *An intelligent hybrid NLP tool designed to detect, explain, and help prevent French language learner errors.*

---

## 📘 Overview

**DetectErreur** is a hybrid Natural Language Processing (NLP) system built to assist **learners of French** by not only correcting written errors but also providing **pedagogically meaningful explanations**.  

While most grammar or spelling correction tools merely detect and fix mistakes, *DetectErreur* goes further: it promotes **understanding**. Each correction comes with **research-supported, constructive feedback** — enabling learners to internalize grammar rules and avoid repeating errors in the future.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- 🩵 **Educational Value First** – provide feedback that fosters learning, not just correction.  
- 🧩 **Error Classification** – categorize mistakes (spelling, syntax, morphology, agreement, etc.) following linguistic and pedagogical frameworks.  
- 🤖 **Hybrid NLP Approach** – combine rule-based systems and modern AI (machine learning) for accuracy and interpretability.  
- 🌱 **Ethical & Sustainable Design** – prioritize transparent, responsible AI and energy-efficient development practices.

## 🧬 Core Features (Planned)

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| ✍️ **Error Detection** | Identify orthographic and syntactic irregularities in user-written French. |
| 💬 **Constructive Feedback** | Provide explanations of errors |
| 📚 **Linguistic Classification** | Group detected issues into pedagogically meaningful categories. |
| ⚙️ **Hybrid Architecture** | Combine linguistic rules and machine learning based components for reliable performance. |
| 🌐 **User Interface** | Intuitive interface for learners to input text and review personalized feedback. |

---

## 🧑‍🔬 Research Basis

The system’s feedback mechanism and classification of errors draw from established **second language acquisition (SLA)** and **didactic linguistics** research.  
Each correction aims to not only point out what is wrong, but **how** to fix it — bridging the gap between **automation** and **education**.

---

## ⚖️ Ethical Commitment

Detecterreur is developed with a firm commitment to:
- Transparency in model behavior and data sources.  
- Respect for user privacy and data security.  
- Environmentally responsible computing practices.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Preliminary)

| Layer | Technologies |
|-------|---------------|
| **Backend / NLP Core** | Python, spaCy, Transformers, custom rule-based grammar modules |
| **Frontend (planned)** | FastAPI, Svelte |
| **Data / Evaluation** | Annotated learner corpora, error-tagged datasets, human evaluation |
| **Environment** | GitHub, Linux-based deployment |
